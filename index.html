Finally, if you've always wanted to try out portrait photography but worry you don't have enough experience, please read the following testamonials:</p>
          <blockquote>My name is Amy and I'm a barista in Portland. I've always wanted to try modeling, but have always been too intimidated to try. I finally was convinced by a freind to check out PDX Portraits and was amazed at the vibe. Everyone was so nice and not competitive at all! I paired up with a few photographers at the event and had a blast. I still feel like a complete newbie when it comes to modeling, but I now know there's a group I can work on my craft and develop a small modeling portfolio.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>I'm Antonio, I'm a photographer and I move recently from Italy to Portland. I am looking for a good fit of photographer and models. It's hard to find good people! This group was great! I have lots of fun at each event and have created other projects with people I meet at the group.</blockquote>
